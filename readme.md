# Python PWM to LT-Spice

Python Script to generate a PWL file for LT Spice voltage sources.

## Getting Started

Get the repo.

```
git clone git@github.com:t-xigit/pyt-lt_spice-sin-pwl.git
```
**Warning: This project does not work in a virutal enviornment. The matplot library seems to be the problem**

### Prerequisites
